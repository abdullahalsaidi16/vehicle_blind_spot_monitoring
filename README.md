# Vehicle Blind Spot Monitoring using a Single Camera

Driving a vehicle is a complicated process in terms of the various variables need to be managed, range from road conditions to the other driver's movements wither they are expected or not, either intended or unintended misdealing with any of these critical variables will may lead to accidents in a way or another; hence research have been kicked off creating a new domain, "Driver Assistant Features", in an attempt to boost driver's control over vehicle by using Artificial intelligence capabilities to avoid vehicles crash as an instance.
This project is categorized as one of "Driver Assistant Features", which uses computer vision-based algorithm that depends on a single camera attached to the body of the car to observe the vehicle's blind spot and detect the hazard of collision with another vehicle moving around when changing the lane unintentionally or for overtaking a vehicle ahead.

### Prerequisites

To Run The Code you have to install python 2.7 and The following Modules:
- numpy
- opencv with contrib module ( We used 3.3.1 dev )
